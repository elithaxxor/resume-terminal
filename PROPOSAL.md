# Feature Proposal

The following ideas could extend the Resume Terminal project:

1. **Theme Selector** – allow visitors to switch between light and dark terminal themes.
2. **Command History** – store typed commands so users can navigate them with the arrow keys.
3. **Download Resume** – provide a command to download a PDF version of the resume.
4. **Analytics Dashboard** – add a private admin page to visualize visitor logs stored in SQLite.
5. **Docker Support** – package server and client in Docker containers to simplify deployment.

These additions would enhance usability and make the project easier to maintain and deploy.
